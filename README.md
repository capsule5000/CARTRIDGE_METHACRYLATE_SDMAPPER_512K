# CARTRIDGE_METHACRYLATE_SDMAPPER_512K

This methacrylate cartridge is specially designed for the SDMAPPER 512K PCB of the project Fabio Belavenuto and creator of the PCB Luciano Sturaro. It has all the custom cutouts for the x2 SD slots, and two switches. It also incorporates the STL file to print in 3D the separators that close the cartridge. You have to superglue the back of the cartridge with the sides and top of the casing
